            <h2>Facilities Operated by the Kenyan MOH</h2>

                <p>The country of Kenya is in the midst of transition. Currently, the Kenyan government working to implement the Vision 2030 plan to create "a globally competitive and prosperous country with a high quality of life", and transition from a third world country to an industrialized, middle income country. Part of this strategic plan is to provide a comprehensive, affordable, and efficiently integrated healthcare system, and thus improve the overall livelihood of all citizens.</p>
                <p>Healthcare in Kenya is provided by a collection of organizations including the Ministry of Health (MOH), other public institutions, faith-based missionary organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and private practice. With the support of private, NGO, and missionary based organizations, the MOH plans to focus on preventative medicine at the community level, developing a robust infrastructure countrywide, improving the quality of service, and providing access to those excluded from health care for financial or other reasons. The MOH has developed the Health Sector Strategic and Investment Plan (KHSSP) to address these needs (now on its second term).</p>
            <h2>Kenya Package for Health (KEPH)</h2>
                <p>The MOH, as part of the KHSSP II, has integrated all state-run health programs into a single system that attempts to address improvement of health by utilizing a tiered health care delivery system. This plan is referred to as the Kenya Package for Health (KEPH) and has defined the following health care levels:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>KEPH 4 (Community Level): All services most effectively delivered within the community. All non-facility based health services are classified as community level.</li>
                    <li>KEPH 3 (Primary Care Level): First physical health care facility level. Comprised of dispensaries, health centers, maternity/nursing homes. Most health care needs should be addressed at this level.</li>
                    <li>KEPH 2 (County Level): First level hospitals, who provided complementary services to KEPH 2 facilities, including inpatient, and other comprehensive services.</li>
                    <li>KEPH 1 (National Level): Tertiary level hospitals with highly specialized services, including but not limited to surgical, neurology, oncology, and internal medicine.</li>
                </ul>
